# Week 00: from an abstract data type to a realistic implementation.

The assignment can be found in the Jupyter notebook named [assignment.ipynb](./assignment.ipynb).

There are several ways to work on this assigment.

## Codespaces

**Requires some familiarity with Github and Codespaces.**

You can accept this assignment through the GitHub classroom, open the Github repository, click on the green "code" button, and select "create codespace on main". This will launch a web-based instance of Visual Studio Code with everything you need to work on the assigment.

In this case it's important to remember that no one can see your Codespace but you. When you are ready to submit the assignment, you must commit and synchronize your Codespace with Github. In Sakai, paste the link to your repository in the Github classroom.

## Google Colab

Colab is a Jupyter notebook environment from Google. If you have a Google email address, you have access to Colab. Direct your browser to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). In the File menu, click Open, click on Github, paste the following URL in the text box:
```text
https://github.com/lgreco/comp-460-f25-week-00/blob/main/assignment.ipynb
```
and then click on the search button (it looks like a magnifying glass). You'll see the notebook `assignment.ipynb` appearing. Click on the `open assignment.ipynb in new tab` button -- it looks like a square with an arrow pointing out.

When it's time to submit your assignment, go to your Colab's share option, make your notebook public, copy its link, and paste the link to Sakai.

## Your own environment

The previous two options are useful if you wish to carry out your work in a Jupyter notebook. If you present to use plain Python, or any other programming language, you are welcome to use any environment you are familiar with. In this case you may have to copy and paste some code, if you are working with Python, or write everything from scratch if you are working in another language.

When you are ready to submit your work, upload the file with your code in Sakai.

## What not to upload.

Under any circumstances, do not upload a Jupyter notebook to Sakai. That's a file with the extension `.ipynb` to Sakai. It will disqualify your submission.

If you work with Jupyter notebooks, you may only submit either a link to a Github repository or to a public Colab notebook.

A link ending in `.dev` is *not* a repository link.

The only files you may upload is standard source code files: `.py` for Python, `.java` for Java, etc.

If you are not certain, ask.
