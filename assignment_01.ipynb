    "\n",
    "In class we discussed the _minimum heap property_ using a binary tree as the underlying abstract data structure. In that representation, we required that <mark>_every parent node is smaller than or equal to both its children._</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure is a mechanism that returns always the smallest of the $n$ elements it contains, in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_2 n)$ time. This is faster than searching for the smallest element in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ or sorting the array in $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log_2 n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this abstract data structures, we have two options. Either build a binary tree using node objects or use a plain array. A plain array is preferrable because it has a smaller memory footprint. This implementation requires parent-children relations based on array index values. These relations are given in the methods below.\n"

    "### When is the heap property violated?\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap property may be violated when we add a new element to the array. It is also violated when we remove its first element, and we fill the resulting gap with the last element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding an element to the heap\n",
    "\n",
    "A new element is added to the next available position in the underlying heap array. As we discussed in class, we prepare an array with enough elements to accommodate a binary tree with $M$ levels. It can be proven, with mathemagical induction, that for such a tree we need an array of length $2^M-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements are added to the array from left to right -- so we need to keep track of the next available position. To do so, we introduce a variable to count the elements used in the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "element_counter = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we add an element to the heap array, we increment the counter by 1. The current value of this counter also tell us where to place the next element in the array -- i.e., the next available position. Obviously, we need to be careful and ensure that `element_counter < len(heap_array)` if we use Java or another language with fixed-size arrays. In Python arrays (ok, lists) are dynamic, so we don't have to worry about running out of space. But we still need to track where to place the new element and what's the total number of elements in the underlying heap array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can sketch a method for adding new data to the minimum heap -- we assume the heap stores strings, like the example we did in class. Treat the code below as pseudocode.\n",

    "#### Removing an element from the heap\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only remove, and return, the first element of the heap -- it's guaranteed to have the smallest value among all elements stored in the heap. Once the first element of the heap is removed, the position at index 0 becomes vacant. We fill it with the last element of the heap. Then we check to see if the newly placed element violates the minimum heap property. If it does, we go through the necessary swaps to restore it.\n",
